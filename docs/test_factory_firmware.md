# Test if Unit-ASR has factory firmware

The Unit-ASR might already have factory firmware but is in sleep mode.

## Try saying these wake words loudly and clearly:

1. **"Hi M Five"** (most common)
2. **"Hi ASR"**
3. **"Hello"**
4. **"Hey ASR"**

## Then try these commands:

- "play"
- "pause"
- "next"
- "previous"
- "turn on"
- "turn off"

## If nothing works:

The Unit-ASR definitely needs firmware flashed via:
- Windows machine with PACK_UPDATE_TOOL.exe
- OR finding the hardware BOOT pin/button on the module
